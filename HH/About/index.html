    <h2>The Healthline Helper is designed to help find nearby locations of help centers for people who have substance abuse issues by displaying the locations of different help centers in your zipcode. Some other ways the Healthline Helper helps are providing links or numbers to therapeutic locations, hotlines, and information on different drugs.
